That said, it's important to distinguish exactly what a Performance Consultant does. There are many ways to address and resolve business problems, but what separates Performance Consulting from Business Consulting is that we tend to specialize in talent-centered solutions versus market strategies, IT strategy and other business-related components.&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">---======&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;"><strong>Lack of Employee Investment</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;"><em>- Lack of Performance and Employee Rewards
</em></span></p><p>With a shortage of talent, i didn't say bodies, but talent, I am shocked at the companies who still operate without offering benefits on day one. Most people come in knowing they are indispensbale to an organization. They will be used by the company for their skills and talents, so in exchange to create a win-win, benefits should be offered on Day 1, not Day 90.</p><p><br></p><p><em>- Lack of Competitive Pay</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Toxic Culture</strong></p><p>- The company with the best culture wins. Organizational psychology underpins the culture of the organization. This means that how the majority of your people think will be reflected in what they say and do. At a high-level, this illustrates your culture is represented within the quality of your products and services.&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;"><br></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;"><em>Favoritism</em></span><br></p><p>When a current or former employee speaks of favoritism, they tend to be speaking of special attention or passes afforded to others&nbsp;</p><p>- Lack of Flexibility</p><p>People are working harder than ever, working outside of normal work hours, and even on weekends, stems from poor project management, not setting realistic deadlines.</p><p><br></p><p>- Lack of Growth</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Poor Management</strong></p><p><em>- Lack the leadership</em></p><p>Don't have the necessary skills to lead
.</p><p>
<span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">I noticed they leaned towards internal promotions to maintain the integrity of their company culture, but if the culture is toxic, then the culture is driving force behind performance issues.&nbsp;</span></p><p>
<span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">Many of the leaders I met were place there by default, meaning, when one person leaves, they promote the next person in line, maybe the person that once served as a direct report to the now gone leader. They were doing this with no succession plan in place. Having a succession plan will atleast prepare future leaders for the positions they may one day hold if they are identified as a good candidate for leadership.</span></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Poor communications</strong><br></p><p><em>- lack of communications to get people on board and support necessary change</em></p><p>- &nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">the one's that were left to take over didn't know what they were doing. Shortly thereafter I realized, that pattern was displayed throughout every aspect of the corporate office. No wonder they are having issues, and if people knew what was really going on, they likely wouldn't touch this place with a ten foot pole, besides that the reviews on job boards was a direct reflection of the internal issues, specifically performance issues, but what the investors only recognize financial impacts.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;"><br></span></p><p>See, all businesses are in business for one thing: Money. &nbsp;Behind the value proposition, therein lies the primary focus, which is how we communicate our values through products and services in order to gain market presence and power.</p></div>

I longed to work for this client due to my interest in the industry; however, once I got a closer look at their internal structure, to be frank, I wanted to run for the hills. But I couldn't.
<br>
<br>For one, this is what I signed up for. I was hired to work on a large-scale <em><strong>change management</strong></em> project for a new system implementation. But, from my perspective, they had other problems and really needed an entire team with experience in transforming organizational behavior and implementing change effectively and efficiently. 
<br>
<br>With so many red flags, I was inspired to outline several reasons change management efforts fail.<br><br></p>
